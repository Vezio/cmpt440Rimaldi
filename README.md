# Formal Languages and Computability

## Class Project

### Abstract

A Grammar specifies a rigid rule set for generating valid strings from a specific language's alphabet. A Grammar enables a program to transform source code (that is syntactically valid, according to the Grammar), that would normally act as a linear sequence of some format of characters, into a syntax tree, or a parse tree, through a process called Lexical Analysis. Lexical Analysis of a grammar breaks down a sequence of characters into a collection of tokens. This process assigns some predetermined meaning to each token thereby generating a deterministic finite automaton as a state machine (or regular expression). In this project, the first stage of a compiler -- the Lexical Analysis phase -- will be developed to generate a deterministic finite automaton based on a specified grammar. If time permits, further stages and enhancements not explicitly recognized in this abstract will be made as additions to the project with the consent of Professor Rivas. 

### How to run the project
To run all test cases, please navigate to the directory `cmpt440Rimaldi/project/writeup/code/src`

Then run:

`chmod +x ./run.sh`

`./run.sh`
